    <h3>Skills</h3>
<p>
    Hereâ€™s how you can frame your learning phase in Python, HTML, and CSS for your portfolio:
    
    Learning Journey in Python, HTML, and CSS
    
    As a first-year B.Tech student, I am actively exploring the fundamentals of programming and web development.
    
    Python: I am currently learning Python, focusing on core concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions. Through hands-on projects and exercises, I am developing my problem-solving skills and understanding how to implement algorithms.
    
    HTML & CSS: I am also diving into web development, starting with HTML and CSS. I am learning how to create structured, visually appealing web pages, understanding the principles of responsive design, and experimenting with various layout techniques.
    
    This learning phase has been incredibly rewarding, and I am excited to apply these skills in real-world projects as I continue my journey in technology.</p>
